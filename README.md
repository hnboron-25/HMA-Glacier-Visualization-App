## Spatial Visualization of Glaciers Across High Mountain Asia (HMA) with Attention to Surge-type Glaciers
In this Shiny app, view data from the RGI 7.0 Glacier Product and examine spatial relationships of glaciers across HMA.

The app itself is in the **HMA_Surge_Glaciers** folder, and pulls data from a cleaned .csv named, **RGIcleaned.csv.**

Multiple tabs in the main pane switch between plots and maps to show how various types of glaciers in HMA differ or are similar to one another. The fourth tab specifically examines confirmed surge-type glaciers that are associated with glacial lake formation. Major lakes typically form when a glacier surges forward and blocks a tributary valley. In this case, tributary rivers are dammed by the glacier ice, and form lakes that repeatedly fill and drain. This specific case has been observed for Khurdopin, Shisper, and Kyagar Glacier.
